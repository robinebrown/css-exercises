/* Use flexbox rules to create this very common webpage header style. 
The benefit to using flex here is that everything should be _flexible_. 
Check out the two screenshots below to get an idea of how it should scale 
with your screen. Besides flex rules, you'll also want to add some rules 
for margin and padding. (Hint: `ul`s have some default margin/padding 
that you will need to deal with.)*/
